The goal was to create an agent that can consistently win games of 2048. This agent is able to win nearly every time but its implementation is far from perfect. I ended up using Monte Carlo to search for the best solutions on the game board but implementing an expectiminimax search would be much better.\r\n\r\nMonte Carlo works by taking a serialized version of the board and simulating log2(largestTile) * 8 number of games to find out which initial direction yeilds the highest score on average. Because the algorithm has to simulate so many complete virtual games for each individual moves its performance leaves something to be desired. \r\n\r\n### Screenshot\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n  <img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/oyDB19j.png\" alt=\"Screenshot\"/>\r\n</p>\r\nScreenshot is from a game that was in progress. The algorithm will actually reach the 4096 tile fairly frequently.\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\nChanges and improvements are more than welcome! Feel free to fork and open a pull request.
